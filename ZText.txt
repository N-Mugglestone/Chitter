As a trainee software engineer
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

- create page that displays input peeps
- interface for user to input peeps 
- inputs into an array


As a trainee
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

-reverse all inputs in the page to display the more recent at the top
-show all peeps on a page 


As a trainee
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

-timestamp each peep and connnect it to the input message (pop-up/ above or belo messages)

As a trainee
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

- sign up page 
- send data to database to be stored and called when needed 

As a trainee
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

- call and check data matches username and password to 'log in'
- re-route page to message board page 

As a trainee
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

- 'log out' and return to chitter msg page || homepage if time permits 

- You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.

- Trainee software engineers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. ewithers@digitalfutures.com, password123, Edward Withers, dearshrewdwit).

- The username and email are unique. - call database and check input data against existing data 

- Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the trainee and their user handle - attach username to message

- Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.
