# üí´ :zap: THE CHITTER CHALLENGE (all caps needed!) ‚ö°:dizzy:
 
### This was my first ever full stack application project, front end, back end, the whole works!

This project was assigned during the final few weeks of the DF Academy and gave me the chance to make a Full Stack application from scratch, it allowed me to design everything and gain a great understanding of how it could run, how to debug code as well as how to solve small problems that would be hard to find. 

For this project I used alot of dependencies

Good luck and let the chitter begin!

Features:
-------

### Standard Acceptance Criteria

So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a trainee
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a trainee

For this project my main take aways were the importance of DOM models and how applying CSS is something that is best to wait until the end of a project. I found that it would be easier to do one page at a time and having a skeleton ‚ò†Ô∏è of the webpage rather than flesh out one page and then more onto the next as elements would be uneven and could cause complications further down the process. Also the importance to take breaks, unless you want to become a zombie. üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### ‚ùì Try again? :question:

If I were to do this again I would start with more tests and a more structured approach to the individual user stories, rather than jumping head first and trying to do a bit of eberything at once.

## Most importantly I found how much fun this kind of project could be. It is just the beginning of my journey!
